# üñºÔ∏è Pictle

Pictle is a simple yet surprisingly challenging game inspired by
[Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/). Rather than guessing a word,
players start with a word and a visual pattern that you must replicate by
guessing words with letters in (and not in) the appropriate places.

Pictle puzzles trail Wordle by one week - the puzzle for today was the Wordle
puzzle from 7 days prior.

Pictle was created by [@mbleigh](https://pictle.web.app) and is powered by
