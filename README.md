# 🖼️ Pictle

Pictle is a simple yet surprisingly challenging game inspired by
[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). Rather than guessing a word,
players start with a word and a visual pattern that you must replicate by
guessing words with letters in (and not in) the appropriate places.

Pictle puzzles trail Wordle by one week - the puzzle for today was the Wordle
puzzle from 7 days prior.
